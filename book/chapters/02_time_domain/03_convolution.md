# Convolution

## Overview

This section provides a comprehensive treatment of convolution in both continuous and discrete time domains.

## Topics to be Covered

- Convolution integral and sum
- Properties of convolution
- Graphical convolution
- Computational methods
- Applications in system analysis

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Compute convolution analytically and graphically
- Apply convolution properties
- Use convolution for system analysis
- Implement convolution algorithms

## Interactive Examples

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Placeholder for convolution examples
print("Convolution examples will be implemented here.")
print("This section is under development.")
```

## Exercises

1. Compute the convolution of exponential and step functions
2. Perform graphical convolution
3. Implement convolution using different algorithms

## Summary

*This section is under development. Content will be added progressively.*
