# Exercises - Chapter 2: Time Domain Analysis

## Exercise 2.1: Continuous-Time Convolution

Compute the convolution y(t) = x(t) * h(t) for the following pairs:

1. x(t) = u(t) and h(t) = e^(-at)u(t)
2. x(t) = e^(-t)u(t) and h(t) = u(t)
3. x(t) = sin(t)u(t) and h(t) = e^(-t)u(t)

## Exercise 2.2: Discrete-Time Convolution

Compute the convolution y[n] = x[n] * h[n] for:

1. x[n] = u[n] and h[n] = a^n u[n]
2. x[n] = δ[n] + δ[n-1] and h[n] = u[n]
3. x[n] = cos(πn/4)u[n] and h[n] = (0.5)^n u[n]

## Exercise 2.3: System Analysis

For each system, find the impulse response and determine if it's stable:

1. y(t) + 2y'(t) = x(t)
2. y[n] - 0.5y[n-1] = x[n]
3. y(t) = ∫₀ᵗ x(τ) dτ

## Exercise 2.4: Step Response

Find the step response for the systems in Exercise 2.3.

## Exercise 2.5: Graphical Convolution

Perform graphical convolution for:
- x(t) = rect(t) and h(t) = rect(t-1)
- x[n] = {1, 2, 1} and h[n] = {1, 1, 1}
