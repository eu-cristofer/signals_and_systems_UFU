# Exercises - Chapter 4: Laplace Transform

## Exercise 4.1: Laplace Transform

Compute the Laplace transform of:

1. x(t) = e^(-at)u(t)
2. x(t) = tu(t)
3. x(t) = sin(ωt)u(t)
4. x(t) = δ(t)

## Exercise 4.2: Properties

Use Laplace transform properties to find:

1. L{tx(t)} if L{x(t)} = X(s)
2. L{x(t-t₀)u(t-t₀)} if L{x(t)} = X(s)
3. L{e^(at)x(t)} if L{x(t)} = X(s)

## Exercise 4.3: Inverse Transform

Find the inverse Laplace transform of:

1. X(s) = 1/(s+a)
2. X(s) = 1/(s²+ω²)
3. X(s) = s/(s²+ω²)
