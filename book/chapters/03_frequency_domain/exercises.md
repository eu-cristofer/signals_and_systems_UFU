# Exercises - Chapter 3: Frequency Domain Analysis

## Exercise 3.1: Fourier Series

Find the Fourier series representation for:

1. Square wave: x(t) = 1 for 0 < t < T/2, -1 for T/2 < t < T
2. Sawtooth wave: x(t) = t/T for 0 < t < T
3. Half-wave rectified sine: x(t) = sin(ω₀t) for 0 < t < T/2, 0 for T/2 < t < T

## Exercise 3.2: Fourier Transform

Compute the Fourier transform of:

1. x(t) = e^(-at)u(t)
2. x(t) = rect(t/T)
3. x(t) = sinc(t)

## Exercise 3.3: Properties

Use Fourier transform properties to find:

1. F{tx(t)} if F{x(t)} = X(jω)
2. F{x(t-t₀)} if F{x(t)} = X(jω)
3. F{x(at)} if F{x(t)} = X(jω)

## Exercise 3.4: DFT

Compute the DFT of:

1. x[n] = {1, 1, 1, 1}
2. x[n] = {1, -1, 1, -1}
3. x[n] = cos(πn/2) for n = 0, 1, 2, 3
