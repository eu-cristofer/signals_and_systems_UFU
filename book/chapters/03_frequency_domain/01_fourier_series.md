# Fourier Series

## Overview

This section covers the representation of periodic signals using Fourier series.

## Topics to be Covered

- Trigonometric Fourier series
- Exponential Fourier series
- Convergence conditions
- Parseval's theorem
- Applications

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Compute Fourier series coefficients
- Analyze periodic signals in frequency domain
- Apply Parseval's theorem
- Understand convergence properties

## Interactive Examples

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Placeholder for Fourier series examples
print("Fourier series examples will be implemented here.")
print("This section is under development.")
```

## Summary

*This section is under development. Content will be added progressively.*
