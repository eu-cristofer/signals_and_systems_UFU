# Exercises - Chapter 7: Filter Design

## Exercise 7.1: Analog Filters

Design analog filters with the following specifications:

1. Low-pass: passband 0-1 kHz, stopband >2 kHz, 3 dB ripple
2. High-pass: passband >500 Hz, stopband <200 Hz, 1 dB ripple
3. Band-pass: passband 1-3 kHz, stopband <500 Hz and >5 kHz

## Exercise 7.2: Digital Filters

Design digital filters with the following specifications:

1. FIR low-pass: cutoff 0.3π, length 21
2. IIR low-pass: cutoff 0.3π, order 4
3. FIR high-pass: cutoff 0.7π, length 31

## Exercise 7.3: Filter Comparison

Compare the performance of:

1. Butterworth vs Chebyshev filters
2. FIR vs IIR filters
3. Different window functions

## Exercise 7.4: Implementation

Implement and test:

1. Moving average filter
2. Exponential smoothing filter
3. Median filter
