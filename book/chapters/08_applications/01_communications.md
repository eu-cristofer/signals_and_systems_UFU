# Communications Applications

## Overview

This section covers applications of signals and systems in communications.

## Topics to be Covered

- Modulation and demodulation
- Channel coding
- Equalization
- Synchronization
- Error correction

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Understand communication systems
- Implement modulation schemes
- Design channel equalizers
- Analyze system performance

## Interactive Examples

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Placeholder for communications examples
print("Communications applications examples will be implemented here.")
print("This section is under development.")
```

## Summary

*This section is under development. Content will be added progressively.*
