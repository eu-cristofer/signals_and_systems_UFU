# Z-Transform: Definition and Properties

## Overview

This section covers the Z-transform and its fundamental properties.

## Topics to be Covered

- Definition of Z-transform
- Region of convergence
- Basic properties
- Common transform pairs
- Applications

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Compute Z-transforms
- Determine regions of convergence
- Apply transform properties
- Use Z-transforms for system analysis

## Interactive Examples

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
