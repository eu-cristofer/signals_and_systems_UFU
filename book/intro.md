Welcome to the Signals and Systems course! This interactive textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of signals and systems, with a focus on both continuous-time and discrete-time analysis.

## Course Overview

This course covers the mathematical foundations and practical applications of signal processing and system analysis. You will learn to:

- Analyze signals in both time and frequency domains
- Understand system properties and responses
- Apply transforms (Fourier, Laplace, Z-transform) for system analysis
- Design and analyze filters
- Work with sampling and reconstruction of signals

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

1. **Classify signals and systems** according to their properties
2. **Analyze linear time-invariant (LTI) systems** using various mathematical tools
3. **Apply frequency domain techniques** for signal analysis and system design
4. **Design basic filters** for signal processing applications
5. **Understand sampling theory** and its implications in digital signal processing
6. **Use computational tools** (Python/MATLAB) for signal analysis and visualization
