# Fourier Transform

## Overview

This section covers the Fourier transform for aperiodic signals.

## Topics to be Covered

- Definition and properties
- Transform pairs
- Convolution theorem
- Modulation theorem
- Applications

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Compute Fourier transforms
- Apply transform properties
- Use convolution theorem
- Analyze signals in frequency domain

## Interactive Examples

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Placeholder for Fourier transform examples
print("Fourier transform examples will be implemented here.")
print("This section is under development.")
```

## Summary

*This section is under development. Content will be added progressively.*
