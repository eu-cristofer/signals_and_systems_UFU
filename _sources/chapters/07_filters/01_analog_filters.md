# Analog Filter Design

## Overview

This section covers the design of analog filters.

## Topics to be Covered

- Butterworth filters
- Chebyshev filters
- Elliptic filters
- Bessel filters
- Filter specifications

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Design analog filters
- Compare filter types
- Meet design specifications
- Analyze filter performance

## Interactive Examples
