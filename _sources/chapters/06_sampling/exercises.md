# Exercises - Chapter 6: Sampling and Reconstruction

## Exercise 6.1: Sampling Theorem

For each signal, determine the minimum sampling rate:

1. x(t) = cos(2π·100t)
2. x(t) = cos(2π·100t) + cos(2π·200t)
3. x(t) = sinc(100t)

## Exercise 6.2: Aliasing

Analyze the aliasing effects when sampling at different rates:

1. x(t) = cos(2π·150t) sampled at 200 Hz
2. x(t) = cos(2π·250t) sampled at 200 Hz
3. x(t) = cos(2π·350t) sampled at 200 Hz

## Exercise 6.3: Reconstruction

Implement and compare reconstruction methods:

1. Zero-order hold
2. Linear interpolation
3. Ideal sinc interpolation

## Exercise 6.4: Anti-aliasing

Design anti-aliasing filters for:

1. Audio signal (0-20 kHz) sampled at 44.1 kHz
2. Video signal (0-5 MHz) sampled at 10 MHz
3. Control signal (0-1 kHz) sampled at 2 kHz
