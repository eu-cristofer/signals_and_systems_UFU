# Continuous-Time Analysis

## Overview

This chapter covers the analysis of continuous-time signals and systems in the time domain.

## Topics to be Covered

- Continuous-time convolution
- Impulse response analysis
- Step response
- System properties in time domain
- Differential equation solutions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Analyze continuous-time LTI systems
- Compute convolution integrals
- Determine system properties from impulse response
- Solve differential equations describing systems

## Interactive Examples

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## Exercises

1. Compute the convolution of two rectangular pulses
2. Find the impulse response of a first-order system
3. Analyze the step response of a second-order system
