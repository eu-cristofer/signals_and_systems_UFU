# Discrete-Time Analysis

## Overview

This chapter covers the analysis of discrete-time signals and systems in the time domain.

## Topics to be Covered

- Discrete-time convolution
- Difference equations
- Impulse response of discrete systems
- System properties in discrete domain
- Z-transform applications

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Analyze discrete-time LTI systems
- Compute discrete convolution
- Solve difference equations
- Determine system stability

## Interactive Examples

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## Exercises

1. Compute the discrete convolution of two sequences
2. Find the impulse response of a discrete system
3. Analyze the stability of a discrete system
