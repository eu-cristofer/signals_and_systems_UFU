# Exercises - Chapter 5: Z-Transform

## Exercise 5.1: Z-Transform

Compute the Z-transform of:

1. x[n] = a^n u[n]
2. x[n] = n u[n]
3. x[n] = sin(ωn) u[n]
4. x[n] = δ[n]

## Exercise 5.2: Properties

Use Z-transform properties to find:

1. Z{nx[n]} if Z{x[n]} = X(z)
2. Z{x[n-k]u[n-k]} if Z{x[n]} = X(z)
3. Z{a^n x[n]} if Z{x[n]} = X(z)

## Exercise 5.3: Inverse Transform

Find the inverse Z-transform of:

1. X(z) = 1/(1-az⁻¹)
2. X(z) = z/(z-1)²
3. X(z) = z/(z²-2z+1)

## Exercise 5.4: System Analysis

For the system with transfer function H(z) = 1/(1-0.5z⁻¹):

1. Find the impulse response
2. Determine if the system is stable
3. Find the step response
