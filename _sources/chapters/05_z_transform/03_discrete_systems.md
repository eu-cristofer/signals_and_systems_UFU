# Discrete Systems Analysis

## Overview

This section covers the application of Z-transforms to discrete system analysis.

## Topics to be Covered

- Transfer functions
- System stability
- Frequency response
- Pole-zero analysis
- System design

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Analyze discrete systems using transfer functions
- Determine system stability
- Design systems using pole-zero placement
- Analyze frequency response

## Interactive Examples

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Placeholder for discrete system analysis examples
